# Basics
This is a test using markdown language.
I can write directly here using the typical text styling rules **bold**, _italic_, ~~this one~~,...
For more information see the [Documentation](https://docs.requarks.io/en/editors/markdown)

I can write code
```javascript
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(true);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setOpen(!open);
  };
```

```python
  class WikiClass:
  	def __init__():
    	self.wiki = 0
```

I can put latex formulas:
$$f(x) = x_1,...,x_n$$
